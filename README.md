# verilog
Sequential Verilog code describes behavior based on clock events using constructs like always @(posedge clk) or @(negedge clk). It is used to model flip-flops, registers, and finite state machines (FSMs). Sequential logic depends on past states, enabling timing-dependent operations essential for RTL design and synthesis.
